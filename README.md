## Data Science Prep Course SLU01 and SLU03 

In this repository you can find the Small Learning Units (SLU) 01 and 03 that I wrote for the Lisbon Data Science Starters Academy (LDSSA) Prep Course after revision by fellow volunteers. These are detailed lessons on Python programming sprinkled with humour.

On `./week 1/SLU01 - Programming Basics` the introductory concepts of Python are explored, while on `./week 2/SLU03 - Flow Control` the students are introduced to `for`-loops and `if` statements
